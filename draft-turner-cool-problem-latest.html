  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The need exists for a unified approach to network management of constrained devices as well as constrained networks. Constrained devices imply the solution should require minimal resources (CPU, memory) from the device platform; constrained networks imply the network management solution should impose minimal traffic on the network to accomplish a particular management objective.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#ref_for_later" id="ref_for_later">Problem Statement</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The problem of network management for constrained networks and devices includes a number of requirements not necessarily provided by existing solutions.  Any solution must be conservative with &#8220;when&#8221; network traffic is required, as well as &#8220;how much&#8221; traffic is required in order to fulfill network management functions. In addition, a solution should support &#8220;traditional&#8221; network management functions that have been useful in a variety of legacy use-cases, as well as new functionality that address the evolving constrained device and constrained device scenarios. In this context, the term &#8220;constrained&#8221; implieslimited resources (RAM, FLASH), as well as limited CPU resources.  Therefore, the amount of code necessary to achieve network management functionality will need to be as small as possible, as well as the amount of RAM necessary to achieve the functionality will be limited. Likewise, minimal network bandwidth should be required to support a solution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">The IETF is coalescing around a set of solutions for transport of applications on constrained networks (CoAP).  Since constrained devices will likely include support for this constrained &#8220;stack&#8221;, it would be advantageous to reuse this constrained device stack for network management as well, to address the constrained device property of limited resources.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Additionally, the IETF is moving towards YANG as a data modeling language for configuration and state data often attributed to network management problems.  Therefore, any constrained device/network management solution should attempt to reuse this information when and where possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration and state data manipulated by the NETCONF protocol (RFC 6241), NETCONF remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.YANG was originally deswork with the NETCONF configuration protocol; however, the idea of constrained networks and devices was not a factor in the design of NETCONF/YANG.  Any solution that attempts to use YANG in a constrained environment should apply constrained principles to the application of YANG in these scenarios.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">It would be advantageous to model the particular constrained network management functionality on the evolving NETCONF/RESTCONF operations, since some level of semantic interoperability might be expected by management systems that mix constrained and non-constrained management domains.  One design element that could reduce the amount of traffic &#8220;on the wire&#8221; is the lack of metadata required to be included in management transactions.  Instead of endpoints semantically parsing the meaning of the data and/or traffic, the knowledge of the data and how it is epxected to be used is, instead, required on the endpoints, apriori.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#why-cool-" id="why-cool-">Why CoOL ?</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The IETF has coalesced around the use of CoAP for application traffic on constrained devices and networks, and has published an initial solution for management over CoAP (CoMI). However, there exists a potential for failure, or ambiguity, in the reliable addressing of management data with CoMI.  The solution introduced by CoOL seeks to remedy this potential failure scenario while at the same time utilize the IETF application &#8220;stack&#8221; and management data modeling language (YANG).  The evolution of the CoOL solution will recognize the proliferation of the &#8220;pub/sub&#8221; design pattern by relying on extensions both at the CoAP, as well as CoOL protocol layers where needed. Incorporating the pub/sub design pattern will assist in the application of CoOL into larger scale networks (both constrained and non-constrained).  QUESTION: should we state the CoOL solution can operate in small unmanaged networks, as well as large-scale managed networks ?</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The security considerations applicable to network management of enterprise networks is similar but different to that of constrained networks given the potential risk involved.  The risk involved to enterprise networks could be local to an organization (assets, reputation). However, in the case of constrained networks, it is reasonable to assume greater risk due to the types of application domains constrained devices would be applied (sensors controlling everything from home automation to medical devices).  With greater risk should come a more strict understanding of the attack vectors and vulnerabilities of any and all protocols in use in constrained networks, especially those protocols tasked with the management of a device.</p>
